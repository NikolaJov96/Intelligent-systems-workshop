# Intelligent systems workshop

This repo contains tasks for the intelligent systems workshop, prepared for the computer science program in Petnica Science Center.

Each task can be found in a separate directory. Python files contain skeleton code such that the students do not have to write anything but the algorithm. Each file contains an empty function that should be completed. Each task implements a visualization that should help preview and debug the task. This visualization is produced by running the task file.
